# LLM Text Detection Project

This repository contains code for a model aimed at identifying essays generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to those written by middle and high school students. With the proliferation of LLMs, concerns have arisen regarding their potential impact on education, including the facilitation of plagiarism and alteration of traditional skill development pathways. This project addresses these concerns by developing a model capable of detecting telltale signs of LLM-generated text, thus aiding in the identification and mitigation of plagiarism.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises essays written by both human students and LLMs, covering various topics typically encountered in middle and high school curriculum. Each essay is labeled according to its source, whether human-written or LLM-generated.

## Models
Two different approaches were explored for text detection:

1. **Bidirectional LSTM Model**: This model utilizes bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn patterns and features indicative of LLM-generated text. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequence data, making them a natural choice for text classification tasks.

2. **Traditional Machine Learning Model**: In addition to the LSTM approach, a traditional machine learning model was implemented. This model incorporates common machine learning techniques, such as:
   
   - Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
   - TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforming text into numerical features based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.
   - Classification Algorithms: Utilizing algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest classifiers for distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated essays.

   These components are combined to create a traditional machine learning model capable of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated essays.
